# File_Creation_Time
Find the difference in file modification time between file A and file B.  T

This script is usefull when a process is creating 100's to 1000's of files.  I my case I was creating 1000's of PDF's and wanted to see how long the average PDF took to create.  I did this by finding the difference in modification time between the Newer PDF and the Previous PDF.  The only necessay input is the directory you wish to analysis.
